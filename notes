Preprocessing:
Important preprocessing type: OneHotEncoder
--this takes text and turns that into numerical data that sci-kit learn can use
--This is useful if the string data is y

Metrics:
-- Need metrics to choose between which models is best
--recall_score: did i get all fraud cases (ex. high precision when low fraud cases)
--precision_score:given I predict fraud, how accurate am i (ex. high recall when high fraud)
